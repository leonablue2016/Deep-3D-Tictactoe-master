## Overview
This project is an attempt to adapt Deep Q-Learning, as described in [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602v1.pdf) by Mnih et al, for 3D Tictactoe

## Installation Dependencies
* Python 2.7 or 3.5
* TensorFlow 0.10

## TODOS:
* ~~Enumerate best states for 2D tictactoe using minimax~~

* ~~Implement q learning for 2D tictactoe~~

* ~~Extend q learning for 3D tictactoe and see what breaks~~ (couldn't finish enumerating states in state table - 80 million and counting)

* ~~Implement deep q learning using a simple 2-layer neural net for 2D Tictactoe~~ (then 3D Tictactoe)

* Implement policy gradient learning using a simple 2-layer neural net for 2D Tictactoe (then 3D Tictactoe)

* ~~Establish reward rubrics and input format for tictactoe DQN pipeline~~

* ~~Design model pipeline for DQN~~

* Design model pipeling for Policy Gradient Learning

* ~~Experiment with model architecture to improve performance~~
